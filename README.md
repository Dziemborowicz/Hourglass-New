## Prerequisites

- [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48) (click [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer) to download the runtime Web Installer)

## Hourglass Changes

### Installer

- Adds the **Hourglass** executable path to the [Windows App Paths](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/app-registration#using-the-app-paths-subkey), so the **Hourglass** [command-line](https://github.com/i2van/hourglass/blob/develop/Hourglass/Resources/Usage.txt) is available out of the box.

### Portable

#### Ngen Support

Processing the **Hourglass** with the [Native Image Generator (Ngen.exe)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/ngen-exe-native-image-generator) speeds up the **Hourglass** startup.

To run script as an **Administrator** press `Win`+`X` and select the **Windows PowerShell (Admin)** or **Command Prompt (Admin)**. Copy script full path to the console opened and execute one of the following:

- Generate the **Hourglass** native image and its dependencies and install in the native image cache:

```shell
ngen-Hourglass.bat install
```

- Delete the native images of the **Hourglass** and its dependencies from the native image cache:

```shell
ngen-Hourglass.bat uninstall
```

### Command-line

- New command `pause`
- New command `resume`
- New option `--digital-clock-time`, `-c`, `/c`
- New option `--multi-timers`, `-mt`, `/mt`
