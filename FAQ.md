**Minutes** - To start a timer for a specified number of minutes, enter the number of minutes:

- `1` - count down for 1 minute
- `5` - count down for 5 minutes
- `10` - count down for 10 minutes

**Specifying units** - To start a timer specifying the units, enter a number followed by one of the supported units: `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, `days`, `weeks`, `months` and `years` are supported:

- `30 seconds` - count down for 30 seconds
