## How do I add a custom notification sound?

Save the sound file to the folder where you installed the **Hourglass** (typically `%PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\Hourglass`) or to the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Hourglass` directory or to the `Sounds` subdirectory.

Your sound file should then appear when you `Right Click` on any empty space in the **Hourglass** window and select the **Sound** submenu.

The supported formats are `.aac`, `.m4a`, `.mid`, `.midi`, `.mp3`, `.ogg`, `.wav` and `.wma`. If your sound file is not in one of the supported formats, you should convert it first.

## How do I remove a custom notification sound?

Delete the sound file from the folder where you installed the **Hourglass** (typically `%PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\Hourglass`). Be careful not to delete any other files.

## How do I loop the notification sound?

`Right Click` on any empty space in the timer window and check **Loop sound** from the **Sound** submenu.

## How do I stop the timer keeping the computer from going to sleep?

To stop the **Hourglass** keeping the computer from going to sleep, `Right Click` on any empty space in the timer window and check **Do not keep computer awake** in the **Advanced options** submenu.

If the computer goes to sleep while a timer is running, the **Hourglass** will try to wake the computer around the time the timer will expire so the notification sound can be played.

`Right Click` on any empty space in the timer window and check **Show elapsed time instead of time left** in the **Advanced options** submenu.

## How do I create a shortcut that automatically starts a timer with the Hourglass?

To create a shortcut, `Right Click` on your Desktop or the folder where you want to create the shortcut and select **Shortcut** from the **New** submenu. Enter the location where `Hourglass.exe` is (typically `%PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\Hourglass\Hourglass.exe`) followed by the duration or date and time for your countdown in quotes.

Then click **Next**, give your shortcut a name and click **Finish** to create the shortcut.

You can also specify additional [command-line](https://github.com/i2van/hourglass/blob/develop/Hourglass/Resources/Usage.txt) arguments to set other options for the timer.

## What command-line arguments does the Hourglass accept?

You can launch the **Hourglass** and immediately start a timer by running `Hourglass.exe "<duration or date and time>"`. For example, to launch the **Hourglass** and start a 5-minute timer, run `Hourglass.exe "5 minutes"`.

You can also set any option that you can set using the user interface by specifying additional command-line arguments. To view a full list of command-line arguments, run `Hourglass.exe --help` or click [here](https://github.com/i2van/hourglass/blob/develop/Hourglass/Resources/Usage.txt).

## How to launch the Hourglass on Windows startup?

1. Press `Win`+`R`.
2. Execute `shell:startup` to open the `Startup` folder for the current user.
3. Drag and drop the **Hourglass** executable while holding `Alt` key to create the shortcut for the **Hourglass**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Check **Open saved timers on startup** in the **Advanced options** submenu to open all the saved timers on the **Hourglass** startup.

## How to speed up the Portable Hourglass startup?

Processing the **Hourglass** with the [Native Image Generator (Ngen.exe)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/ngen-exe-native-image-generator) speeds up the **Hourglass** startup.

To run script as an **Administrator** press `Win`+`X` and select the **Windows PowerShell (Admin)** or **Command Prompt (Admin)**. Copy script full path to the console opened and execute one of the following:

- Generate the **Hourglass** native image and its dependencies and install in the native image cache:

```shell
ngen-Hourglass.bat install
```

- Delete the native images of the **Hourglass** and its dependencies from the native image cache:

```shell
ngen-Hourglass.bat uninstall
```

## What should I do if the Hourglass does not start?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Hourglass** writes error files in case of the crash to the `%TEMP%` folder (usually it is the `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp` folder). File mask is the `Hourglass-Crash*.txt`.

If the **Hourglass** does not start or fails silently, delete the **Hourglass** settings.

The **Hourglass** settings can be located by the following command (to run it press `Win`+`R` and copy-paste command below):

```shell
cmd /k dir "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Chris_Dziemborowicz*"
```

The settings are stored into the corresponding `hourglass.EXE` subdirectories.

The **Hourglass Portable** keeps settings next to the executable.

## What should I do if there is no notification sound?

Some audio files could not be played for Windows with no [Windows Media Player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Media_Player) installed.
To fix this, download the [NAudioHourglassPack](https://github.com/i2van/hourglass/releases/latest) and upzip its content to the **Hourglass** folder.

The supported formats are:

- `.aiff`
- `.mp3`
- `.ogg`
- `.wav`
